## Asynchronous programming in javascript

In this section, we will learn about asynchronous programming in JavaScript. We will learn about the following topics:

- Asynchronous programming
- What is asynchronous programming in javascript?
- Callback functions in javascript for asynchronous programming
- Promises in javascript for asynchronous programming
- Async/await in javascript for asynchronous programming

### Asynchronous programming

Asynchronous programming in JavaScript allows you to execute code without blocking the main thread, which can improve the performance of your application. In this type of programming, you can perform multiple operations simultaneously, which can make your application more responsive.

### What is asynchronous programming in javascript?

Asynchronous programming is a programming pattern that allows you to perform multiple operations simultaneously. JavaScript is single-threaded, which means that only one operation can be executed at a time. Asynchronous programming enables you to execute code without blocking the main thread, so your application remains responsive.

### Callback functions in javascript for asynchronous programming

In JavaScript, callbacks are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions. When the function completes its task, it calls the callback function. Callbacks are commonly used in asynchronous programming to handle the results of asynchronous operations.

For example, the following code snippet shows a callback function that is passed as an argument to a setTimeout function:

```javascript
// callback function Example
setTimeout(() => {
	console.log("Hello, javascript !");
}, 1000);
```

In this code, the setTimeout function will wait for 1000 milliseconds before calling the callback function, which will log "Hello, javascript!" to the console.

### Promises in javascript for asynchronous programming

Promises are a more recent addition to JavaScript, and they provide a cleaner way to handle asynchronous operations. A promise represents the result of an asynchronous operation, and it can be in one of three states:

- **Pending**: The initial state of a promise.
- **Fulfilled**: The state of a promise representing a successful operation.
- **Rejected**: The state of a promise representing a failed operation.

You can use the then() method to handle the fulfilled state of a promise, and the catch() method to handle the rejected state.
For example, the following code snippet shows a Promise that is used to load a JSON file:

```javascript
const DataJson = "data.json";
fetch(DataJson)
	.then((response) => response.json())
	.then((data) => console.log(data))
	.catch((error) => console.error(error));
```

In this code, the fetch() function returns a Promise that resolves with the response object. The first then() method converts the response object to JSON, and the second then() method logs the data to the console. The catch() method logs any errors to the console.
Promises are most useful for API implementations in javascript.

### Async/await in javascript for asynchronous programming

Async/await is a more recent addition to JavaScript, and it provides a more readable way to write asynchronous code. Async/await is built on top of Promises, and it allows you to write code that looks synchronous, even though it's asynchronous under the hood.

For example, the following code snippet shows an async function that is used to load a JSON file:

```javascript
async function loadJSON() {
	try {
		const response = await fetch("data.json");
		const data = await response.json();
		console.log(data);
	} catch (error) {
		console.error(error);
	}
}

loadJSON();
```

In this code, the loadJSON() function is declared as async, which allows us to use the await keyword inside the function. The try/catch block is used to handle errors. The await keyword is used to wait for the fetch() and response.json() functions to complete before continuing.

### Conclusion

Asynchronous programming is an essential concept in JavaScript, and it's critical to understand it if you want to write efficient, responsive applications. Callbacks, Promises, and async/await are three ways to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript, and each has its advantages and disadvantages.
