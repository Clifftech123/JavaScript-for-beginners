## Generators and async/await in JavaScript

### What are generators?

Generators are a type of function in JavaScript that can be paused and resumed, allowing for the generation of a series of values on demand. Generators are declared using the function\* syntax and use the yield keyword to return a value from the generator function.

Here's an example of a generator function that generates an infinite series of Fibonacci numbers:

```js
// Generator function that generates an infinite series of Fibonacci numbers

function* fibonacci() {
  let [prev, curr] = [0, 1];
  while (true) {
    [prev, curr] = [curr, prev + curr];
    yield curr;
  }
}
```

To use the fibonacci generator, we can create an iterator object and call its next method to get the next value in the sequence:

```js
//  Create an iterator object from the generator function

const sequence = fibonacci();
sequence.next(); // { value: 1, done: false }
sequence.next(); // { value: 2, done: false }
sequence.next(); // { value: 3, done: false }
sequence.next(); // { value: 5, done: false }
sequence.next(); // { value: 8, done: false }
sequence.next(); // { value: 13, done: false }
```

Generators are useful for creating custom iterators and for implementing lazy evaluation, where values are generated only when needed.

### async/await function in javascript ?

async/await is a language feature introduced in ECMAScript 2017 that simplifies asynchronous code by allowing developers to write asynchronous code that looks and behaves like synchronous code.

The async keyword is used to declare a function that returns a promise, and the await keyword is used to pause the execution of the function until a promise is resolved.

Here's an example of an async function that retrieves data from an API:

    ```js

// Async function that retrieves data from an API

async function getData() {

const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
const data = await response.json();
return data;
}

    ```

In the getData function, the await keyword is used to pause the function until the response is received from the API and until the data is parsed as JSON.

To use the getData function, we can call it like a regular function and use the then method or the await keyword to retrieve the data:

```js
getData().then(data => console.log(data));
// or
const data = await getData();
console.log(data);

```

The async keyword is used to declare a function that returns a promise, and the await keyword is used to pause the execution of the function until a promise is resolved.

async/await makes it easier to write asynchronous code that is easier to read, write, and maintain. It also allows for better error handling, as any errors that occur in an async function can be caught using a try-catch block.


### What is the difference between async/await and generators?

async/await and generators are both used to write asynchronous code in JavaScript. However, there are some key differences between the two:

-   Generators are functions that can be paused and resumed, while async functions are functions that return promises.
-   Generators can be used to create custom iterators, while async functions can only be used to create promises.

### What are the benefits of async/await?

Async/await is a language feature that was introduced in ECMAScript 2017. It simplifies asynchronous code by allowing developers to write asynchronous code that looks and behaves like synchronous code.
